C Programming for Everybody
===========================

This repository contains code I've written while working through Charles Severance's [C Programming for Everybody] course video.

In the course, Chuck reads through the first edition of Kernighan and Ritchie's book "The C Programming Language". He adds some commentary as/when he thinks it'd be useful.

Why might you want to watch Chuck do that? To quote Chuck:

> The **learning objective of this course** is not so much how to code C because it's your job, but "**what in C is necessary to make a higher level language like Python, or JavaScript, or Java, or C# work**. And we'll get to that before the end of the course.
